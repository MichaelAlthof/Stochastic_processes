Description: 'Similarity of both random walk and AR-1 (autoregressive process) to actual stock prices.
The blue path is a random walk over 50 time points. The red path is a First-order autoregressive (AR-1) process over 50 time points.
Model: X_t = 100 + r(X_t-1 - 100) + e_t. Mean reverting to 100, 0 < r < 1.
In each case epsilon terms/innovations are normally distributed - N(0,1).'

Keywords: 'approximation, autoregressive, normal-distribution, plot, random, random-number-generation, random-walk, similarity, simulation,

Input:
- N: number of simulated time points
- StartVal: Starting value for X_0
- rho: First AR-parameter (rho * X_t-1)

Example:
- 1: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 1, rho = 0.8'
- 2: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 2, rho = 0.8'
- 3: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 3, rho = 0.8'
- 4: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 1, rho = 0.95'
- 5: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 2, rho = 0.95'
- 6: 'Realized path for the random walk and AR(1) : simulation 3, rho = 0.95'
